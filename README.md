# Closed Circles Android Client

Originally a fork of [original Closed Circles client by yak32](https://github.com/yak32/ClosedCirclesAndroid)
made with the intent of getting rid of org.apache.http dependencies, bringing it to Android 6.0 and improving
offline reading features. Not sure if I have plenty of time to work on this, so I could not promise a lot of
action, except that I'm going to dogfood this instead of original client and will fix everything I'll bump into.

## Closed Circles

A moderately popular project, ["Group Chat done right"](http://closedcircles.com), something like an IRC cross-bred with web-chats circa 1998.
